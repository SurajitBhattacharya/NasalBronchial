##Human airway epithelial nasal and bronchial progenitor cell programs are defined in early infancy##

The airway epithelium is a unified structure extending from the nasal passages to the bronchi1,2. Although nasal and bronchial human airway epithelial cells (AECs) share more than 90% of their transcriptomic programs, important differences have been reported, including distinct pro-inflammatory profiles and a higher proportion of secretory/goblet cells in the nasal epithelium. However, it remains unclear whether these differences arise solely from site-specific differentiation or reflect intrinsically distinct progenitor cell programs identifiable in their undifferentiated state. Furthermore, it is unknown whether these structural and functional differences are present at birth or emerge along a defined postnatal developmental trajectory. Given the central role of AECs in the pathogenesis of asthma and other chronic airway diseases3, resolving these questions may provide novel insights into the early origins of respiratory disorders. Here, we address this critical gap by utilizing bulk and single-cell transcriptomic analyses of human nasal and bronchial AECs across pediatric age groups, uncovering their site-specific progenitor cell programs and developmental trajectories during early life.
